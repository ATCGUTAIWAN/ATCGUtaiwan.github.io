		<h2>Design</h2>
		<p>在未來，人類醫學將面對的最大宿敵也許不是癌症，而是基因經過不斷的突變產生的多重抗藥性或者其他危害。今日，我們團隊設計的檢測晶片則是以對抗抗藥性基因為出發點的產品，隨著環境快速變化以及抗生素的濫用，細菌基因突變的速率超出人類的想像，以 MSSA 為例，因為抗生素誘導其產生抗藥性基因 mecA ，演變為新型菌株 MRSA，我們團隊以此為雛形，透過通電和 DNA 專一性雜合的方式為概念，達到快速且節省成本的方式篩檢出結果。我們也希望不斷改良檢測晶片來增進其效率，以面對未來的危機。</p>
		<p>為了解決問題，我們計劃設計一個可以高度專一性檢測出抗藥性基因的 DNA 晶片。在實驗的設計上主要分為兩個部分：工學院電子電路設計，以及分子生物設計。</p>
		
		<h2>半導體</h2><hr>
		<p>In the concept of the chip, we have designed a great breakthrough, the design of bi-electrodes, in order to achieve greater specificity and to subvert the limitations of previous biodetectors, which can only detect shorter DNA segments.</p>
		<img src="bi-electrodes.png">
		<p>Both electrodes are connected to each probe, at the same time, target DNA will connect each probe just like a bridge. When the bridge was built successfully, allowing the electronic pass through, and we can detect it. The design can subvert the limitations of previous biodetectors, which can only detect shorter DNA segments. We can detect any length of target DNA by adjusting the distance between the two electrodes. Taking the model used in this experiment, mecA gene of MRSA as an example, we set the distance between the two electrodes to 2000 nm. Because the shorter distance may affect the quality of the chip by hand-making.</p>

		<p>At present, due to limitations in the process, we have no way to control the distance between the two electrodes very accurately. The long distance between the electrodes will affect the length of the probe and the bonding between the probe DNA and the target DNA. As the result, we make a little adjustment on our design. We changed the original flatform to a platform design. In the platform design, graphene and Au are selected on the material of the electrode, and both are conductive materials which can be well connected to modify DNA.</p>
		<img src="cv.png">
		<p>In detecting the connection between DNA and the electrode, cyclic voltammetry is used. Cyclic voltammetry gradually change the voltage under the same current, and the redox reaction of the sample is observed, and the result of the connection is judged by the type and change of the figure value.</p>
		<p>The way to make the electrodes is to perform the lithography process in the room which the light is yellow. The lithography is to temporarily coat the surface of the chip with photoresist, and design the mask to transfer the design pattern to the photoresist, which is the most important in chip manufacturing.</p>
		<center><img src="pfd1.png" style="max-width:450"><img src="pfd2.png" style="max-width:450"></center>
		<p>Photoresist is a light-sensitive substance that responds specifically to ultraviolet light, that is the reason why the lithography process is carried out in the room with yellow light. The photoresist can be temporarily coated on the upper surface of the chip, and the design pattern is transferred thereon by exposure. The method can be divided into positive photoresist and negative photoresist according to whether or not dissolved after exposure. The method used in this experiment is positive photoresist. After the development technique, the exposed portion is dissolved. Although the cost of positive photoresist is higher than negative photoresist, the resolution is better.</p>
		<p>The coating of hexamethyldiamine (HMDS) before the photoresist increases the adhesion of the photoresist to the chip surface. The key to determining the pattern is the mask. After using the computer software AutoCAD to export the electrode pattern, you can entrust the company to make it. The development is the softening of the dissolved photoresist after it exposed to the ultraviolet light. Excessive development may cause partial erosion of the electrode, and if it is not developed completely, the completion degree of the electrode may be poor.</p>
		<p>The etching method in this experiment is wet etching, and the substrate is immersed in an etching solution to etch the ITO covered by the photoresist, wherein the etching solution is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, water and nitric acid in a specific ratio. Evaporation is a coating technique in which a material to be vaporized is heated by a resistor or an electron beam to a melting temperature under high vacuum conditions to evaporate atoms and reach and adhere to the surface of the substrate. During the evaporation process, the substrate temperature has a significant influence on the properties of the deposited film. Usually, the substrate also needs to be heated appropriately so that the vapor-deposited atoms have sufficient energy to move freely on the surface of the substrate to form a uniform film.</p>
		
		<h2>分生</h2><hr>
		<p>The degree of relatedness of two species can be estimated by examining how similar their base pair sequences are. The method of assessing relatedness uses of DNA hybridization. The technique of DNA hybridization is based on two principles: the first, the double strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs, and the second is that the more closely related two species are, the greater will be the number of complementary base pairs in the hybrid DNA. Hybridization of DNA is accomplished by heating strands of DNA from two different species to 86° C. This breaks the hydrogen bonds between all complementary base pairs. The result is many single-stranded segments of DNA appear. The single-stranded DNA from both species is mixed together and allowed to slowly cool. Similar strands of DNA from both species will begin to chemically join together or re-anneal at complementary base pairs by reforming hydrogen bonds. The resulting hybrid DNA is then reheated and the temperature at which the DNA becomes single-stranded is noted again.</p>
		<p>At the part of molecular biology experiment, we use the primer express 3.0 software to design the primer on the probe of our chip. The condition we choose is the C + G content should between 40 to 60 percent, because it will be hard to anneal together when C + G content is lower than 40 percent (because a G-C base pair has three hydrogen bonds and A-T pair only has two) and the Tm will be too low when C + G content is higher than 60 percent. And the Tm should be between at 55 – 60 ⁰C, it will cause the self-dimer when Tm is too low and will be too hard to anneal together when Tm is too high, and the discrepancy between forward and reverse cannot exceed 2 ⁰C because the condition of forward and reverse will be too different to successfully anneal. And the length of primer should between at 18 – 32 base pair and cannot appear self-dimer and hairpin. A and T should not be appeared at the last or the head of the primer sequence and should avoid duplicate sequence ( ex AGTTTGCA、CGTATATAG ), after designing, we use the ncbi blast to confirm our primer.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, we have two kinds of chip which different from the space of two electrodes. One of the distance is 2000 nm and deduct the target DNA 600 nm, the probe of two sides must longer than 700 nm and shorter than 1000 nm. Take off the 80 - 150 base pairs primer we designed, each strand of probe must have at least 2000 base pairs sequence. The other distance is 1000 base pairs and deduct the target 800 - 900 base pairs, the probe of two sides is approximately 50 - 60 base pairs. In this 2000 nm or 1000 base pairs sequence, the C + G content must be higher than 40 percent too. And it is more higher when they are some duplicate base pairs in our sequence ( ex AAAAA、CGCGCGCGCG ). At the sequence we designed, we not only have to focus at the conductivity but also the structure of our sequence ( ex hairpin and self-dimer ). It is a tough challenge for our design.</p>
