		<h1>Abstract</h1>
		<p>In recent years, the problem of drug resistance genes caused by antibiotic abuse has become more and more serious, and it is more likely to extend the super-strong drug-resistant bacteria. In order to suppress this situation, we have designed a detector that can quickly identify drug resistance genes, <b>"bri<font color="red">D</font>ge a<font color="red">N</font> er<font color="red">A</font>"</b>.</p>
		<p><b>"bri<font color="red">D</font>ge a<font color="red">N</font> er<font color="red">A</font>"</b> uses a specific conductive material to make two electrodes. First, using the complementary characteristics of DNA, two different probes can be designed for drug resistance genes, and the probes are respectively connected to the electrodes on both sides.</p>
		<p>Second, the characteristics of DNA conduction are used as connected bridges, simply use the measurement of electrical changes, so that not only can quickly detect long-segment DNA, but also can detect multiple gene fragments in parallel to increase the accuracy of drug administration and slow down more drug resistance.</p>

			<h2>Background</h2><hr>
			<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double-helical macromolecule. With two sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside, it comprised of repeated stacks of either adenine (A)–thymine (T) or (G)–cytosine (C) base pairs, coupled by hydrogen bonds(Watson–Crick model).</p>
			<center><img src="atgc.png" style="max-width:600"></center>
			<p>DNA is the carrier of genetic information and the foundation material of biological heredity. Besides, sequence-specific DNA, which are distinct in any living organism, virus or pathogen, can be detected based on the hybridization with its complementary strand. DNA possesses complementarity, self-assembling and self-recognition ability that always forms hydrogen-bonded base pairs where the base pairs line up one-dimension-ally at 0.34–0.36 nm intervals.</p>
			<p>A key structural feature, which makes DNA a promising candidate for applications in nanometer-scale electronics, is the array of π-stacked base pairs. As a functional nano-size material, DNA possesses properties of both nano-scale templates and molecular wires. Taking advantage of properties of DNA and integrating them with current semiconductor technology could lead to the development of nano-scale electronic devices, including biosensor.</p>
			<center><img src="biosensor.png" style="max-width:600"></center>
			<p>Coupling a biological recognition element that interacts with the target analyte and a transduction element, DNA biosensors are used to obtain DNA sequence specific information. In other words, it have wide range of application including DNA based diagnosis and pathogen detection. Electrochemical DNA-based biosensors have been widely developed due to the remarkable advantages of easy operation, rapid response, less power requirement, miniaturized platform and low cost. DNA-electrochemical biosensor is formed by an electrode (the electrochemical transducer) with a DNA probe (the biological recognition element) immobilized on its surface and is used to detect DNA-binding molecules (the analyte).</p>

			<h2>Problem</h2><hr>
			<h3>Problem one: How to face antibiotic resistance genes?</h3>
			<p>WHO defines super bacteria as microorganisms that develop antimicrobial resistance. The mechanism by which super bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics is basically controlled by genes, collectively referred to as drug resistance genes. Some bacteria are inherently resistant to genes, and may be transmitted via plastids to obtain resistance genes from other bacteria. In today's clinical medicine, antibiotics are an obvious treatment for bacterial infections, and as a result, they are medically abused. With the emergence of different antibiotics, especially the broad-spectrum antibiotics, the bacteria with the resistance gene have been forced to survive and threaten humans. In the rapid evolution process, bacteria can survive quickly adapting to the environment, and drug resistance genes make existing antibiotics useless. These super bacteria cause humans to face the great impact of medical care. In the face of serious bacterial infections, the use of antibiotics is necessary, but in the environment of antibiotics, more and more drug-resistant bacteria will emerge. It leads to the dilemma of medical treatment. Therefore, how to quickly and accurately diagnose whether a human infected bacteria has a drug resistance gene and identify its type, so that accurate drug administration, thereby reducing inappropriate antibiotic use, is the key to greatly reduce the possible emergence of super bacteria.</p>
			<center><img src="superbug.png" style="max-width:600"></center>
			<h3>Problem two: What is MRSA?</h3>
			<p>One of the most globally important microorganisms is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Staphylococcus aureus is a major human and veterinary pathogen worldwide. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus poses a significant and enduring problem to the treatment of infection by such strains. MRSA has become epidemic not only in nosocomial infections but also in community associated infections . MRSA that has been a common cause of nosocomial infections worldwide also has been arising in the community in recent years . Invasive infections of MRSA have high morbidity and mortality rates . Most of invasive staphylococcal and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections are related to the nasal carriage of Staphylococcus . Resistance is usually conferred by the acquisition of a nonnative gene encoding a penicillin binding protein (PBP2a), with significantly lower affinity for β-lactams. This resistance allows cell-wall biosynthesis, the target of β-lactams, to continue even in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. PBP2a is encoded by the mecA gene, which is carried on a distinct mobile genetic element (SCCmec), the expression of which is controlled through a proteolytic signal transduction pathway comprising a sensor protein (MecR1) and a repressor (MecI). Many of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying methicillin resistance in S. aureus have been elucidated, including regulatory events and the structure of key proteins.</p>
			<h3>Problem three: If we want to detect a longer target DNA?</h3>
			<p>The common biosensor is a single electrode, and a single electrode can only detect a DNA fragment of a probe length, about 16-30 mer, and it is impossible to determine a longer-length target DNA and a sequence that does not complement the probe, that is, it cannot be accurately judged whether the added sample is 100% of our target DNA. The two electrodes pass through as the bridge, and the probe DNA on both sides is added to the target DNA to carry an energized circuit. A complete long piece of DNA can be carried on the pier formed by the DNA probes on both sides, so that the electrodes on both sides can form a pathway. The different distances between the electrodes and different probe lengths  can be adjusted with the target DNA to detect more complete long-segment target DNA under more specific conditions.</p>
			
			<div class="pt" id="Goal"  ></div>
			<h2 class="cap">Goal</h2><hr>
			<p>Within the timeframe of BIOMOD, it is important to make a balance between realistic and ideal in our project. Our ideal goal is to produce a biosensor that can detect different antibiotic resistance gene; however, for the competition, we’d like to take some strategies. And by means of these strategies, we can produce a prototype first, verify the core concept of our project, and test the feasibility of our product.</p>

			<div class="pt" id="Future"></div>
			<h2>Future</h2><hr>
			<h3>Optimization</h3>
			<p>After constantly pondering, combining the fluorescent substance on DNA will be our new goal. Now, there are many similar fluorescent detecting way, but there are many problems about fluorescent intensity and wavelength lead to most of light to be too weak or belong to invisible light. Because it can not be observed by eyes, we still need to use instrument to detect it. We consider that the step of instrument detect is most likely to break through. If we can accomplish using visible light to determine test result, not only promotes the reliability because of audiovisual result, but also has effect of double check. After that we should overcome the problems of fluorescent intensity and combining of fluorescent substance with detecting instrument. Biofilm is the feasible way we think, using HRP and receptor TMB’s chemical reaction to produce colored biofilm. It can prove if sample link with target DNA. Let us easily to determine result.</p>
			<h3>In parallel</h3>
			<p>Separately, large quantity and diverse test are our goal, too. We clearly know that the advantage of our products is using electric circuit to leave out complex PCR steps. It can save a lot of time. Thus, developing the advantage is another way. The design of in parallel electric circuit is our new idea. It is only feasible by combining electric circuit. In parallel electric circuit means we can test our sample a lot in the same time, even targets are not only mecA fragment, we also can complete easily. In the sequence, we only need to change the probes on the chips. In the length, keeping the length of two side electrode and adjustmenting length of probes. That can make many chips models for different test gene. So come, there will be a unique chip.</p>
			<h3>POC</h3>
			<p>Cooperating mass production our product not only reduces cost of production, but also promotes popularity rate, even reaches the commercial level. The simple, creative and increasing test efficiency way is our biggest goal. Getting better test efficiency can assist us to apply in hospitals and people’s home broadly. Separately, due to medical of third world is not universal. Using medicine is not accurate, lead to the spread of super bacteria. Thus, if our detecting chips can achieve POC, that will be the medical resource foe promoting the medical quality in the third world.</p>
			<p>After thinking the refine and modifying possibility, our chips is still a monomer, even if an ideal product, but if there has any possibility that combines diverser technology products to challenge the infinity possibility of chips? After exploring farther, carrying the carefully designed chips to the hot topic, AI robot, has potential. When AI robot formally go into the medical, the function intensity of robot determines its practicality. Our gene test chips are the best tools to improve robot’s performance. Before testing the pretreatment of sample will doing in the robot. Completely develops our advantages, precision, simplify steps, quick test and low cost. Certainly, the advanced idea must produce more technical problems, not only electronic engineering or medical have to be solved. If the chips can achieve the high efficacy like these ideas, we believe we can get the better answer about how human to face the drug resistance gene in the future.</p>

		<p>在未來，人類醫學將面對的最大宿敵也許不是癌症，而是基因經過不斷的突變產生的多重抗藥性或者其他危害。今日，我們團隊設計的檢測晶片則是以對抗抗藥性基因為出發點的產品，隨著環境快速變化以及抗生素的濫用，細菌基因突變的速率超出人類的想像，以 MSSA 為例，因為抗生素誘導其產生抗藥性基因 mecA ，演變為新型菌株 MRSA，我們團隊以此為雛形，透過通電和 DNA 專一性雜合的方式為概念，達到快速且節省成本的方式篩檢出結果。我們也希望不斷改良檢測晶片來增進其效率，以面對未來的危機。</p>
		<p>為了解決問題，我們計劃設計一個可以高度專一性檢測出抗藥性基因的 DNA 晶片。在實驗的設計上主要分為兩個部分：工學院電子電路設計，以及分子生物設計。</p>
		<h2>半導體</h2><hr>
		<p>In the concept of the chip, we have designed a great breakthrough, the design of bi-electrodes, in order to achieve greater specificity and to subvert the limitations of previous biodetectors, which can only detect shorter DNA segments.</p>
		<img>
		<p>Both electrodes are connected to each probe, at the same time, target DNA will connect each probe just like a bridge. When the bridge was built successfully, allowing the electronic pass through, and we can detect it. The design can subvert the limitations of previous biodetectors, which can only detect shorter DNA segments. We can detect any length of target DNA by adjusting the distance between the two electrodes. Taking the model used in this experiment, mecA gene of MRSA as an example, we set the distance between the two electrodes to 2000 nm. Because the shorter distance may affect the quality of the chip by hand-making.</p>
		<img>
		<p>In terms of material selection, we need to find out the material that has both conductive properties and binding affinity with  DNA. We decided to use ITO and Au. ITO as a conductive transparent film, and the transmittance of the coating in the visible range. It is approximately inversely proportional to the conductivity. Main components of ITO are 90 wt% In2O3 and 10 wt% SnO2. In our experiments, we chose an ITO glass substrate with a transmittance of 100%. Au is one of the materials widely used in sensor electrodes.</p>
		<p>At present, due to limitations in the process, we have no way to control the distance between the two electrodes very accurately. The long distance between the electrodes will affect the length of the probe and the bonding between the probe DNA and the target DNA. As the result, we make a little adjustment on our design. We changed the original flatform to a platform design. In the platform design, graphene and Au are selected on the material of the electrode, and both are conductive materials which can be well connected to modify DNA.</p>
		<img>
		<p>In detecting the connection between DNA and the electrode, cyclic voltammetry is used. Cyclic voltammetry gradually change the voltage under the same current, and the redox reaction of the sample is observed, and the result of the connection is judged by the type and change of the figure value.</p>
		<p>The way to make the electrodes is to perform the lithography process in the room which the light is yellow. The lithography is to temporarily coat the surface of the chip with photoresist, and design the mask to transfer the design pattern to the photoresist, which is the most important in chip manufacturing.</p>
		<img>
		<p>Photoresist is a light-sensitive substance that responds specifically to ultraviolet light, that is the reason why the lithography process is carried out in the room with yellow light. The photoresist can be temporarily coated on the upper surface of the chip, and the design pattern is transferred thereon by exposure. The method can be divided into positive photoresist and negative photoresist according to whether or not dissolved after exposure. The method used in this experiment is positive photoresist. After the development technique, the exposed portion is dissolved. Although the cost of positive photoresist is higher than negative photoresist, the resolution is better.</p>
		<p>The coating of hexamethyldiamine (HMDS) before the photoresist increases the adhesion of the photoresist to the chip surface. The key to determining the pattern is the mask. After using the computer software AutoCAD to export the electrode pattern, you can entrust the company to make it. The development is the softening of the dissolved photoresist after it exposed to the ultraviolet light. Excessive development may cause partial erosion of the electrode, and if it is not developed completely, the completion degree of the electrode may be poor.</p>
		<p>The etching method in this experiment is wet etching, and the substrate is immersed in an etching solution to etch the ITO covered by the photoresist, wherein the etching solution is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, water and nitric acid in a specific ratio. Evaporation is a coating technique in which a material to be vaporized is heated by a resistor or an electron beam to a melting temperature under high vacuum conditions to evaporate atoms and reach and adhere to the surface of the substrate. During the evaporation process, the substrate temperature has a significant influence on the properties of the deposited film. Usually, the substrate also needs to be heated appropriately so that the vapor-deposited atoms have sufficient energy to move freely on the surface of the substrate to form a uniform film.</p>
		<h2>分生</h2><hr>
		<p>The degree of relatedness of two species can be estimated by examining how similar their base pair sequences are. The method of assessing relatedness uses of DNA hybridization. The technique of DNA hybridization is based on two principles: the first, the double strands of DNA are held together by hydrogen bonds between complementary base pairs, and the second is that the more closely related two species are, the greater will be the number of complementary base pairs in the hybrid DNA. Hybridization of DNA is accomplished by heating strands of DNA from two different species to 86° C. This breaks the hydrogen bonds between all complementary base pairs. The result is many single-stranded segments of DNA appear. The single-stranded DNA from both species is mixed together and allowed to slowly cool. Similar strands of DNA from both species will begin to chemically join together or re-anneal at complementary base pairs by reforming hydrogen bonds. The resulting hybrid DNA is then reheated and the temperature at which the DNA becomes single-stranded is noted again.</p>
		<p>At the part of molecular biology experiment, we use the primer express 3.0 software to design the primer on the probe of our chip. The condition we choose is the C + G content should between 40 to 60 percent, because it will be hard to anneal together when C + G content is lower than 40 percent (because a G-C base pair has three hydrogen bonds and A-T pair only has two) and the Tm will be too low when C + G content is higher than 60 percent. And the Tm should be between at 55 – 60 ⁰C, it will cause the self-dimer when Tm is too low and will be too hard to anneal together when Tm is too high, and the discrepancy between forward and reverse cannot exceed 2 ⁰C because the condition of forward and reverse will be too different to successfully anneal. And the length of primer should between at 18 – 32 base pair and cannot appear self-dimer and hairpin. A and T should not be appeared at the last or the head of the primer sequence and should avoid duplicate sequence ( ex AGTTTGCA、CGTATATAG ), after designing, we use the ncbi blast to confirm our primer.</p>
		<p>Furthermore, we have two kinds of chip which different from the space of two electrodes. One of the distance is 2000 nm and deduct the target DNA 600 nm, the probe of two sides must longer than 700 nm and shorter than 1000 nm. Take off the 80 - 150 base pairs primer we designed, each strand of probe must have at least 2000 base pairs sequence. The other distance is 1000 base pairs and deduct the target 800 - 900 base pairs, the probe of two sides is approximately 50 - 60 base pairs. In this 2000 nm or 1000 base pairs sequence, the C + G content must be higher than 40 percent too. And it is more higher when they are some duplicate base pairs in our sequence ( ex AAAAA、CGCGCGCGCG ). At the sequence we designed, we not only have to focus at the conductivity but also the structure of our sequence ( ex hairpin and self-dimer ). It is a tough challenge for our design.</p>
