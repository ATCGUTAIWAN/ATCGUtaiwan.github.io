		<h2>Background</h2><hr>
		<p>Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a double-helical macromolecule. With two sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside, it is comprised of repeated stacks of either adenine (A)–thymine (T) or (G)–cytosine (C) base pairs, coupled by hydrogen bonds(Watson–Crick model).</p>
		<center><img src="atgc.png"style="max-width:75%;max-height:45%"></center>
		<p>DNA is the carrier of genetic information and the foundation material of biological heredity. Besides, sequence-specific DNA, which is distinct in any living organism, virus or pathogen, can be detected based on the hybridization with its complementary strand. DNA possesses complementarity, self-assembling and self-recognition abilities that always form hydrogen-bonded base pairs where the base pairs line up one-dimension-ally at 0.34–0.36 nm intervals.</p>
		<p>A key structural feature, which makes DNA a promising candidate for applications in nanometer-scale electronics, is the array of π-stacked base pairs. As a functional nano-size material, DNA possesses properties of both nano-scale templates and molecular wires. Taking advantage of properties of DNA and integrating them with current semiconductor technology could lead to the development of nano-scale electronic devices, including the biosensor.</p>
		<center><img src="biosensor.png"style="max-width:75%;max-height:45%"></center>
		<p>Coupling a biological recognition element that interacts with the target analyte and a transduction element, DNA biosensors are used to obtain DNA sequence specific information. In other words, it has a wide range of application including the DNA-based diagnosis and pathogen detection. Electrochemical DNA-based biosensors have been widely developed due to the remarkable advantages of easy operation, rapid response, less power requirement, miniaturized platform and low cost. The DNA-electrochemical biosensor is formed by an electrode (the electrochemical transducer) with a DNA probe (the biological recognition element) immobilized on its surface and is used to detect DNA-binding molecules (the analyte).</p>

		<h2>Problem</h2><hr>
		<h3><li>Problem one: How to face antibiotic resistance genes?</h3></li>
		<p>WHO defines super bacteria as microorganisms that develop antimicrobial resistance. The mechanism by which super bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics is basically controlled by genes, collectively referred to as drug resistance genes. Some bacteria are inherently resistant to genes, and may be transmitted via plastids to obtain resistance genes from other bacteria. In today's clinical medicine, antibiotics are an obvious treatment for bacterial infections, and as a result, they are medically abused. With the emergence of different antibiotics, especially the broad-spectrum antibiotics, the bacteria with the resistance genes have been forced to survive and threaten humans. In the rapid evolution process, bacteria can survive quickly by adapting to the environment, and drug resistance genes render existing antibiotics useless. These super bacteria cause humans to face the great impact from medical care expenses. In the face of serious bacterial infections, the use of antibiotics is necessary, but in the environment of antibiotics, more and more drug-resistant bacteria will emerge. It leads to the dilemma of medical treatment. Therefore, how to quickly and accurately diagnose whether an individual is infected with bacteria that have a drug resistance gene and to identify its type, so that accurate drug administration, thereby reducing inappropriate antibiotic use, is the key to greatly reduce the possible emergence of super bacteria.</p>

		<h3><li>Problem two: What is MRSA?</h3></li>
		<p>One of the most globally important microorganisms is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Staphylococcus aureus is a major human and veterinary pathogen worldwide. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus poses a significant and enduring problem to the treatment of infection by such strains. MRSA has become epidemic not only in nosocomial infections but also in community associated infections . MRSA that has been a common cause of nosocomial infections worldwide also has been on the rise in the community in recent years . Invasive infections of MRSA have high morbidity and mortality rates . Most of invasive staphylococcal and community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections are related to the nasal carriage of Staphylococcus . Resistance is usually conferred by the acquisition of a nonnative gene encoding a penicillin binding protein (PBP2a), with significantly lower affinity for β-lactams. This resistance allows cell-wall biosynthesis, the target of β-lactams, to continue even in the presence of typically inhibitory concentrations of antibiotic. PBP2a is encoded by the mecA gene, which is carried on a distinct mobile genetic element (SCCmec), the expression of which is controlled through a proteolytic signal transduction pathway comprising a sensor protein (MecR1) and a repressor (MecI). Many of the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underlying methicillin resistance in S. aureus have been elucidated, including regulatory events and the structure of key proteins.</p>

		<h3><li>Problem three: If we want to detect a longer target DNA?</h3></li>
		<p>The common biosensor is a single electrode, and a single electrode can only detect a DNA fragment of a probe length, about 16-30 mer, and it is impossible to determine a longer-length target DNA and a sequence that does not complement the probe, that is, it cannot be accurately judged whether the added sample is 100% of our target DNA. The two electrodes pass through as the bridge, and the probe DNA on both sides is added to the target DNA to carry an energized circuit. A complete long piece of DNA can be carried on the pier formed by the DNA probes on both sides, so that the electrodes on both sides can form a pathway. The different distances between the electrodes and different probe lengths  can be adjusted with the target DNA to detect more complete long-segment target DNA under more specific conditions.</p>

		<div class="pt" id="Goal"  ></div>
		<h2 class="cap">Goal</h2><hr>
		<p>Within the timeframe of BIOMOD, it is important to make a balance between reality and ideal in our project. Our ideal goal is to produce a biosensor that can detect different antibiotic resistance genes; however, for the competition, we’d like to make some strategies. And by means of these strategies, we can produce a prototype first, verify the core concept of our project, and test the feasibility of our product.</p>

		<p>For the restriction of time, it is hard to achieve all of the ideas mentioned above in our project. The followings are the three goals for which the short-term goal is the primary one that we will complete before BIOMOD.</p>
		<h3><li>Short-term goal</h3></li>
		<p>In this period, we make efforts to produce a prototype for our ideal biochip, FF, using MRSA for BIOMOD competition-as well as using FF to prove our core concept and the mechanism of  FF itself.</p>

		<h3><li>Long-term goal</h3></li>
		<p>Promote and commercialize our chip FF; in addition, we’d like to recommend it to be used in the Third World and in current medical systems.</p>

		<h2>Future</h2><hr>
		<h3><li>Optimization</h3></li>
		<p>After constantly pondering, combining the fluorescent substance on DNA will be our new goal. Now, there are many similar fluorescent detections, but there are many problems about fluorescent intensity and wavelength, causing most of light to be too weak or belong to invisible light. Because it can not be observed by eyes, we still need to use the instrument to detect it. We consider that the step of instrumental detection is most likely to break through. If we can accomplish using visible light to determine test results, not only promotes the reliability because of audiovisual result, but also has effect of double check. After that we should overcome the problems of fluorescent intensity and combining fluorescent substance with detecting instrument. Biofilm is the feasible way we think, using HRP and receptor TMB’s chemical reaction to produce the colored biofilm. It can prove if the sample's link with the target DNA. Let us easily determine the result.</p>
		<h3><li>In parallel</h3></li>
		<p>Separately, large quantity and diverse test are our goal, too. We clearly know that the advantage of our products is using electric circuit to leave out complex PCR steps. It can save a lot of time. Thus, developing the advantage is another way. The design of the in-parallel electric circuit is our new idea. It is only feasible by combining electric circuit. In-parallel electric circuit means we can test a lot of our samples at the same time, even targets are not only the mecA fragment; we also can complete easily. For the sequence, we only need to change the probes on the chips. For the length, keep the length of two side electrode and adjust the length of probes. That can make many chip models for different test genes. So come, there will be a unique chip.</p>
		<h3><li>POCT</h3></li>
		<p>Cooperating mass production our product not only reduces cost of production, but also promotes popularity rate, even reaches the commercial level. The simple, creative and increasing test efficiency way is our biggest goal. Getting better test efficiency can assist us to apply in hospitals and people’s homes broadly. Separately, due to medical of third world is not universal. Using medicine is not accurate, lead to the spread of super bacteria. Thus, if our detecting chips can achieve POCT, that will be the medical resource for promoting the medical quality in the Third World.</p>
		<p>After thinking the refine and modifying possibility, our chip is still a monomer, even if an ideal product, but if there has any possibility that combines diverser technology products to challenge the infinity possibility of chips? After exploring farther, carrying the carefully designed chips to the hot topic, AI robot, has potential. When AI robot formally goes into the medical field, the function intensity of robot determines its practicality. Our gene test chips are the best tools to improve the robot’s performance. Before testing the pretreatment of sample will doing in the robot. Completely develops our advantages, precision, simplify steps, quick test and low cost. Certainly, the advanced idea must produce more technical problems, not only electronic engineering or medical have to be solved. If the chips can achieve the high efficacy like these ideas, we believe we can get the better answer about how humans face the drug resistance genes in the future.</p>
