				<div class="pt" id="Introduction"></div><h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>The lithography process is a simply and efficient way to print the desired pattern on the chip, which is a well-developed method in semiconductor process technology. The main steps are coating photoresist, alignment and exposure, development and inspection. In photoresist coating step, the temporary usage of photoresist with a uniform thickness on the surface of the chip is a media to transfer the design pattern to the photoresist through the mask and UV illumination... The photoresist used in the lithography is a photosensitive material, especially ultraviolet light. And whole process  the process is carried out in yellow light room (lithography room). There are 2 type of photoresist including positive photoresist and negative photoresist. The positive photoresist is dissolved in the illumination exposed area, and the negative photoresist is the opposite way.  It is important to known the material we will used in process before layout design. After the exposure, the development setup is used to dissolve the non-crosslinked photoresist away. Finally, all patterns should be inspected under optical microscope to make sure the process met our design. If the result is not acceptable, photoresist could be removed by acetone, methanol, and DI water as the rework process. Then a new photolithography process could be continued on the same chip.</p>
				<p>Cyclic voltammetry is a method of changing the potential to obtain the direction of the redox current. Mainly by applying a cyclic potential, from a starting potential to a terminal potential at a fixed rate, and then changing back to the starting potential at the same rate, thereby drawing a CV of a reversible oxidation reactant analysis for the cycle. By measuring the value of the original electrode material and the change in the value of the connected DNA material, it can be determined that the electrode is connected to the probe.</p>
				<div class="pt" id="Experiment"></div><h2>Experiment</h2>
				<ul>
				<li><h3>Planar Electrode</h3></li>
				<p> First, the glass substrate with ITO was immersed in acetone at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove the organic particles or dust, then it was immersed in methanol at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove acetone, then finally it was immersed in diH2O at ultrasonic for 5 min, which the glass was dried by nitrogen gun after completing the above clean process. Testing which side is coating ITO with electric meter after taking the glass and bake it for 15 min at 120°C to prevent the residual -OH from reacting with the PR. The side of ITO was applied HMDS to enhance PR adhesion before applied PR, which used spin coater in 3000 rpm 10 s at 1 step to attach the drug and 5000 rpm 20 s at 2 step to control the thickness of the drug. Note that the two drugs cannot produce any bubbles during the process of dropping the glass substrate. Sending PR-coated ITO to do soft baking for 2 min at 90°C to let PR dry a little and enhance the adhesion. After the glass was soft baking, exposing the pattern of the mask irradiating at a 365 nm ultraviolet light with a mercury lamp for 2.5 s. The way to use that is positive PR, in other words, the part is not covered by the mask and directly contacts the UV light will be eroded. Send the glass to do bake after exposure for 1 min at 90°C to prevent erosion ripples around the chip before developing. Then, the chip was soaked in the developer AZ300MIF and oscillated to remove the etched photoresist, and the PR was observed by a light aligner, a microscope, and a projection comparator, and then sent to do hard baking at 120°C for 15 min to fix the light, which prevents erosion during the moment. Soak the developed ITO in the etchant for approximately 10 min. The formula of etchant is hydrochloric acid 36%, nitric acid 70% and diH2O and the ratio is 50:3:50. The glass immersed in acetone and shook it to get rid of PR and the pattern of ITO electrode would be developed clearly. Finally, the glass substrate printed with the first electrode was placed in a 100% acetone shake to remove the photoresist, and the first electrode on the chip was completed.</p>
				<p> After confirming the state of the first electrode, the process of the second electrode will be performed on the same chip. The chip was immersed in acetone at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove the organic particles or dust, then it was immersed in methanol at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove acetone, then finally it was immersed in diH2O at ultrasonic for 5 min, which the chip was dried by nitrogen gun after completing the above clean process. Bake it for 15 min at 120°C to prevent the residual -OH from reacting with the PR. The side of electrode was applied HMDS to enhance PR adhesion before applied PR, which used spin coater in 3000 rpm 10 s at 1 step to attach the drug and 5000 rpm 20 s at 2 step to control the thickness of the drug. Note that the two drugs cannot produce any bubbles during the process of dropping the glass substrate. Sending PR-coated chip to do soft baking for 2 min at 90°C to let PR dry a little and enhance the adhesion. After the chip was soft baking, exposing the second mask, which have to align the cross pattern of the first pattern and irradiating at a 365 nm ultraviolet light with a mercury lamp for 2.5 s. The part is not covered by the mask and directly contacts the UV light will be eroded. Send the chip to do bake after exposure for 1 min at 90°C to prevent erosion ripples around the chip before developing. Then, the chip was soaked in the developer AZ300MIF and oscillated to remove the etched PR, and the PR was observed by a light aligner, a microscope, and a projection comparator to observe the erosion PR. A layer of approximately 1500 – 1600 Å of gold is then plated with a thermal evaporator. Before the gold plating, the machine must be vacuumed, and the surface of the chip electrode is plated with titanium under vacuum to strengthen the adhesion of gold. Then the solid gold is placed on the tungsten sheet in the evaporation machine, and the time of process is about 9-10 minutes. The gaseous gold will be solidification on the surface of the chip, and after the chip is taken out of the thermal evaporator, the acetone is removed to the PR, and the chip is completed.</p>
				<li><h3>Platform Electrode</h3></li>
				<p> First, titanium is plated on the silicon substrate by a thermal resistance vapor deposition machine to increase the affinity between Au and silicon substrate. Then evaporate a layer of gold from approximately 1500 – 1600 Å. The graphene growing on the PMMA membrane was then tiled on the gold, and the test chip was completed.</p>
				<li><h3>Cyclic Voltammetry</h3></li>
				<p> Before performing the individual connection test between the electrode material and the DNA, the chip must be cleaned with acetone and methanol separately. After the chip is packaged, the initial CV pattern of the chip can be obtained for the first measurement, and then dropped into the environment at 25 ° C. The ssDNA of 10 mM/1 mM/0.1 mM was rested for 16 hr for DNA ligation, and then the DNA was ligated to the chip to obtain a CV chart.</p>
				<p> The surface of the gold electrode needs to be modified to join the DNA. After the chip package is completed, it must first be cleaned by cyclic voltammetry.The first wash was carried out at 1 M NaOH at a speed of 0.3 V / s in the range -0.2 to + 0.8 V, followed by a second wash in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a speed of 0.3 V / s and a range of -0.25 to + 1.75 V.Next, SH modification of the surface of the gold electrode was carried out by placing 1,4-benzenedithiol 10 mM, 10 mL/each for 24 hours.</p>
