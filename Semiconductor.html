				<h3><li>Lithography process</h3></li>
				<p>We used gold and graphene as the materials of the electrode, fabricated the entire chip by means of a lithography process.</p>
				<div class="pt" id="Experiment"></div><h2>Experiment</h2>
				
				<h3><li>Mask</h3></li>
			        <p>After finished the layout design, 2 masks of each layer could be fabricated as shown.It was produced by a lab in National Chiao Tung University.</p>

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　 <p>First electrode: The patterns show the shape of the first electrode. UV would expose through the no-pattern part in the mask.</p>
				<center><img src="electrode2.2.png" class="w3-mobile" style="width:50%;"></center>
				<p><Second electrode> The patterns show the shape of the second electrode. UV would expose through the pattern part in the mask.</p>
				<h3><li>Procession of electrode</h3></li>

	                        <p>Photoresist is a light-sensitive substance that responds specifically to ultraviolet light, that is the reason why the lithography process is carried out in the room with yellow light. The photoresist can be temporarily coated on the upper surface of the chip, and the design pattern is transferred thereon by exposure. The method can be divided into positive photoresist and negative photoresist according to whether or not dissolved after exposure. The method used in this experiment is positive photoresist. After the development technique, the exposed portion is dissolved. Although the cost of positive photoresist is higher than negative photoresist, the resolution is better.</p>
                                <p>The coating of hexamethyldiamine (HMDS) before the photoresist increases the adhesion of the photoresist to the chip surface. The key to determining the pattern is the mask. After using the computer software AutoCAD to export the electrode pattern, you can entrust the company to make it. The development is the softening of the dissolved photoresist after it exposed to the ultraviolet light. Excessive development may cause partial erosion of the electrode, and if it is not developed completely, the completion degree of the electrode may be poor.</p>
                                <p>The etching method in this experiment is wet etching, and the substrate is immersed in an etching solution to etch the ITO covered by the photoresist, wherein the etching solution is a mixture of hydrochloric acid, water and nitric acid in a specific ratio. Evaporation is a coating technique in which a material to be vaporized is heated by a resistor or an electron beam to a melting temperature under high vacuum conditions to evaporate atoms and reach and adhere to the surface of the substrate. During the evaporation process, the substrate temperature has a significant influence on the properties of the deposited film. Usually, the substrate also needs to be heated appropriately so that the vapor-deposited atoms have sufficient energy to move freely on the surface of the substrate to form a uniform film.</p>
				<h3><li>Stacked Electrodes</h3></li>
			        <p>As the lithography process is much more difficult to achieve the goal we set earlier. The distance of two electrodes could not be controlled accurately in every finger int the chip. Even 0.1 degree displacement would led the electrodes in the chip with 40 – 50 % error.</p>
			        <p>Therefore, we used another method, stacking electrode, to test the connection between target and probe DNA instead.</p>

				<div class="pt" id="Conclusion"></div><h2>Conclusion</h2>
                                <p>We have created a biosensor that is different from the previous one. Advanced from single electrode to double electrode, we chose Au and graphene to make electrodes. The largest difficulty in our ideal "FF" planar double electrode design is the control of the distance between two electrodes. The dense electrode and the electrode should be kept 2μm, which requires precise alignment and long-time process. Althoth the planar electrode is more complicated than the stacked electrode, it has larger surface area and can be connected with more target DNA, which will lead to a more sensitivity biosensor. Although the surface area of the platform electrode is reduced, the measurement method is the same as that of the planar electrode measurement. Therefore, due to the time, we will temporarily adopt the platform electrode as the final test measurement.</p>
