平面式電極 [這邊直接用動畫呈現，不用寫太多英文]
將鍍有 ITO 的玻璃基板清洗乾淨，依序以丙酮、甲醇、DI水浸泡並且以超音波震盪機震盪 5 min ，隨即以氮氣槍吹乾水分。進入烘箱 120 ℃以 烘乾 15 min 以去除基板表面之氫氧根，以避免影響光阻的塗佈。接著以三用電表找出具有導電特性的ITO面玻璃，ITO面朝上放上旋轉塗佈機，開啟氣閥確認基板已被吸住不會輕易掉落或是移動。滴上增進光阻附著力的 HMDS ，以轉速 3000 rpm 轉動 10 s 使藥品附著，再以轉速 5000 rpm 旋轉 20 s 控制藥品厚薄程度。再滴上光阻 AZ6112 ，以轉速 3000 rpm 轉動 10 s 使藥品附著，再以轉速 5000 rpm 旋轉 20 s 控制藥品厚薄程度。注意兩種藥品在滴上玻璃基板的過程中不能產生任何氣泡。隨即將塗佈好光阻的玻璃基板送進烘箱以 90 ℃ 軟烤 2 min 使光阻更好的附著。接著將第一道電極之光罩及玻璃基板各別放上光罩對準儀，確認玻璃基板上有完整的電極圖形後以汞燈發射 365 nm 紫外光曝光 2.5 s。接著送進烘箱以 90 ℃ 曝後烤 1 min 減緩駐波效應。接著以顯影劑 AZ300MIF 震盪以去除曝光後被侵蝕的光阻，並利用光照對準儀、顯微鏡、厚度量測儀觀察光阻侵蝕的情況，接著送進烘箱以 120 ℃ 硬烤 15 min以固定光阻防止在時刻過程中被侵蝕 。最後以蝕刻液 ( 30 % HCl : 70 % HNO3 : H20 = 50 : 50 : 3 )去除未被光阻覆蓋的ITO玻璃，最後將印有第一道電極的玻璃基板放入 100% 丙酮震盪以去除光阻，晶片上的第一道電極即完成。
在確認第一道電極的狀態之後，將在相同的晶片上進行第二道電極的製程。
製作過程首先依序以丙酮、甲醇、DI水浸泡並且震盪 5 min ，隨即以氮氣槍吹乾水分。進入烘箱 120 ℃以 烘乾 15 min 以去除晶片之氫氧離子。電極面朝上放上旋轉塗佈機，開啟氣閥確認晶片已被吸住不會輕易掉落或是移動。滴上增進光阻附著力的 HMDS ，以轉速 3000 rpm 轉動 10 s 使藥品附著，再以轉速 5000 rpm 旋轉 20 s 控制藥品厚薄程度。再滴上光阻 AZ6112 ，以轉速 3000 rpm 轉動 10 s 使藥品附著，再以轉速 5000 rpm 旋轉 20 s 控制藥品厚薄程度。注意兩種藥品在滴上晶片的過程中不能產生任何氣泡。隨即將塗佈好光阻的晶片送進烤箱以 90 ℃ 軟烤 2 min 使光阻可以更好的附著。接著將第二道電極之光罩及晶片各別放上光罩對準儀，在確認晶片上有完整的電極圖形，並且有對準第一道電極之十字圖型後以汞燈發射 365 nm 紫外光曝光 2.5 s。接著送進烤箱以 90 ℃ 曝後烤 1 min 減緩駐波效應。接著以顯影劑 AZ300MIF 震盪以去除曝光後被侵蝕的光阻，並利用光照對準儀、顯微鏡、厚度量測儀觀察光阻侵蝕的情況。接著以熱阻式蒸鍍機鍍上一層約 1500 – 1600 Å 的金。鍍金之前必須先將機器抽真空，在真空狀態下在晶片電極面鍍上鈦來加強金的附著力，隨即在蒸鍍機中的鎢片上放固態金，大約 9 - 10 分鐘後被氣態金金會凝華在晶片表面，將晶片拿出蒸氣機後已丙酮進行去光阻的動作，晶片即完成。
First, the glass substrate with ITO was immersed in acetone at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove the organic particles or dust, then it was immersed in methanol at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove acetone, then finally it was immersed in diH2O at ultrasonic for 5 min, which the glass was dried by nitrogen gun after completing the above clean process. Testing which side is coating ITO with electric meter after taking the glass and bake it for 15 min at 120°C to prevent the residual -OH from reacting with the PR. The side of ITO was applied HMDS to enhance PR adhesion before applied PR, which used spin coater in 3000 rpm 10 s at 1 step to attach the drug and 5000 rpm 20 s at 2 step to control the thickness of the drug. Note that the two drugs cannot produce any bubbles during the process of dropping the glass substrate. Sending PR-coated ITO to do soft baking for 2 min at 90°C to let PR dry a little and enhance the adhesion. After the glass was soft baking, exposing the pattern of the mask irradiating at a 365 nm ultraviolet light with a mercury lamp for 2.5 s. The way to use that is positive PR, in other words, the part is not covered by the mask and directly contacts the UV light will be eroded. Send the glass to do bake after exposure for 1 min at 90°C to prevent erosion ripples around the chip before developing. Then, the chip was soaked in the developer AZ300MIF and oscillated to remove the etched photoresist, and the PR was observed by a light aligner, a microscope, and a projection comparator, and then sent to do hard baking at 120°C for 15 min to fix the light, which prevents erosion during the moment. Soak the developed ITO in the etchant for approximately 10 min. The formula of etchant is hydrochloric acid 36%, nitric acid 70% and diH2O and the ratio is 50:3:50. The glass immersed in acetone and shook it to get rid of PR and the pattern of ITO electrode would be developed clearly. Finally, the glass substrate printed with the first electrode was placed in a 100% acetone shake to remove the photoresist, and the first electrode on the chip was completed.
After confirming the state of the first electrode, the process of the second electrode will be performed on the same chip. The chip was immersed in acetone at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove the organic particles or dust, then it was immersed in methanol at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove acetone, then finally it was immersed in diH2O at ultrasonic for 5 min, which the chip was dried by nitrogen gun after completing the above clean process. Bake it for 15 min at 120°C to prevent the residual -OH from reacting with the PR. The side of electrode was applied HMDS to enhance PR adhesion before applied PR, which used spin coater in 3000 rpm 10 s at 1 step to attach the drug and 5000 rpm 20 s at 2 step to control the thickness of the drug. Note that the two drugs cannot produce any bubbles during the process of dropping the glass substrate. Sending PR-coated chip to do soft baking for 2 min at 90°C to let PR dry a little and enhance the adhesion. After the chip was soft baking, exposing the second mask, which have to align the cross pattern of the first pattern and irradiating at a 365 nm ultraviolet light with a mercury lamp for 2.5 s. The part is not covered by the mask and directly contacts the UV light will be eroded. Send the chip to do bake after exposure for 1 min at 90°C to prevent erosion ripples around the chip before developing. Then, the chip was soaked in the developer AZ300MIF and oscillated to remove the etched PR, and the PR was observed by a light aligner, a microscope, and a projection comparator to observe the erosion PR. A layer of approximately 1500 – 1600 Å of gold is then plated with a thermal evaporator. Before the gold plating, the machine must be vacuumed, and the surface of the chip electrode is plated with titanium under vacuum to strengthen the adhesion of gold. Then the solid gold is placed on the tungsten sheet in the evaporation machine, and the time of process is about 9-10 minutes. The gaseous gold will be solidification on the surface of the chip, and after the chip is taken out of the thermal evaporator, the acetone is removed to the PR, and the chip is completed.

首先以熱阻式蒸鍍機在矽基板上鍍上增加金吸附力的鈦及一層約 1500 – 1600 Å 的金。隨即利用戳翻的方式將長在PMMA membrane 上的graphene平舖在金上，測試用晶片即完成。
First, titanium is plated on the silicon substrate by a thermal resistance vapor deposition machine to increase the affinity between Au and silicon substrate. Then evaporate a layer of gold from approximately 1500 – 1600 Å. The graphene growing on the PMMA membrane was then tiled on the gold, and the test chip was completed.
以循環伏安法量測
進行電極材料與DNA個別的連接測試之前必須將晶片依序以丙酮、甲醇清洗乾淨，進行封裝後即可以進行第一次測量得出晶片的初始CV圖，接著在25℃的環境下滴入 10 mM/1 mM/0.1 mM 的ssDNA，禁制 16 hr 進行 DNA 的連接，之後在進行 DNA 與晶片連接後的測量以得到 CV 圖。
Before performing the individual connection test between the electrode material and the DNA, the chip must be cleaned with acetone and methanol separately. After the chip is packaged, the initial CV pattern of the chip can be obtained for the first measurement, and then dropped into the environment at 25 ° C. The ssDNA of 10 mM/1 mM/0.1 mM was rested for 16 hr for DNA ligation, and then the DNA was ligated to the chip to obtain a CV chart.
金電極的表面進行修飾以連接DNA，封裝完成後利用循環伏安法，在 1M NaOH 以速度 0.3 V/s，範圍 -0.2 to +0.8V 進行第一次清洗，再在 0.5 M H2SO4  中以速度 0.3 V/s、範圍 -0.25 to +1.75V 進行第二次清洗。接著以 1,4-benzenedithiol 10mM, 10mL/each 放置 24 hr 進行金電極的表面的SH修飾。
The surface of the gold electrode needs to be modified to join the DNA. After the chip package is completed, it must first be cleaned by cyclic voltammetry.The first wash was carried out at 1 M NaOH at a speed of 0.3 V / s in the range -0.2 to + 0.8 V, followed by a second wash in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a speed of 0.3 V / s and a range of -0.25 to + 1.75 V.Next, SH modification of the surface of the gold electrode was carried out by placing 1,4-benzenedithiol 10 mM, 10 mL/each for 24 hours.
