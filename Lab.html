			<h2>introduction</h2>					
			<h3>USA300</h3>
			<p> USA300 is a strain of community-associated MRSA which became the predominant strain type in the USA since 2011. It may be more virulent than other strains of MRSA in patients with MRSA infections complicated by bacteremia.</p>
			<p> In Taiwan, it identified four MRSA USA300 isolates from children with CA-MRSA infection in 2012, prompting our study on this strain in Taiwan.</p>
			<p> Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a major pathogen in hospitals and the community. It causes a wide range of infections affecting the superficial skin and soft tissue, as well invasive infections including pneumonia, bloodstream infections, bone and joint infections. In the past, most of the infections caused by MRSA were confined to elderly patients in healthcare facilities and they were described as healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA). However, the epidemiology of MRSA changed overtime with the emergence of strains in patients with no previous history of hospitalization which were known as community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA). CA-MRSA strains are more genetically diverse and belong to different clones than HA-MRSA. Some clonal complexes are epidemic and are spread internationally while others are restricted to certain regions. The spread of epidemic MRSA clones globally is of concern since it limits antibiotic options for treating MRSA infections.</p>
			<h3>專一性(22 v.s. 999)</h3>
			<p> With a single electrode, DNA biosensor can detect a DNA fragment only 16-30 mer, limiting by the length of probe. However, based on the properties that electron can transfer through DNA, we use two electrodes which binding the same length of probe as single electrode. It can detect more than 1000 mer by analyzing the conductance. Besides, the target DNA need to hybridize with two different probe to let electron transfer through DNA.</p>

			<h2>experiment</h2>
			<h3>preparation of target DNA</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><h4>Genomic DNA extraction</h4></li>
				<p> Before we extraction the genomic DNA we want, we need to culture the bacteria first. We transfer the bacteria culture to the 40 ml centrifuge tube and culture it overnight ( 16-18 hours ). Alter 1 ml bacteria culture to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube then centrifuge a 1000 rpm at 25 ℃ for 1 minute. Add 100 ul TE buffer to the tube and pipetting the pellet until there is no suspension. Add 20 ul 100 mg/ml lysozyme and 10 mg/ml lysostaphin mixture to the tube then put the tube into the 37 ℃ incubator for 60 minutes and gently shake it every 10 minutes.</p>
				<p>After taking out, add 300 ul cell lysis buffer to break the cell membrane and put in the 60 ℃ incubator and gently shake it every 3 minutes, and cool down for 5 minutes. Add 1.5 ul RNase A and put at room temperature for 5 minutes to remove the RNA. Add 100 ul protein remove buffer and put it on the ice for 10 minutes and precool the centrifuge 10 minutes too. Centrifuge at 13000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4 ℃</p>
				<p>Place the supernatant to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and add 300 ul isopropanol and centrifuge at 13000 for 5 minutes at 4 ℃, then remove the supernatant. Add 300 ul 70 % ethanol and centrifuge for 3 minutes at 25 ℃ then drain it at vacuum environment until there is no ethanol in the tube. Add 100 ul DNA hydration buffer and put in the 60 ℃ incubator for 60 minutes and we will finish the genomic DNA extraction.</p>
				<li><h4>Real-time polymerase chain reaction</h4></li>
				<p>Before running the qPCR machine, we have to blend unknown amount of tubes which contain 1 ul DNA sample, 10 ul KAPA SYBR ® FAST qPCR Master Mix (2X), 0.4 ul forward primer, 0.4 ul reverse primer, 0.4 ul KAPA SYBR ® FAST ROX Low Reference Dye (50X), and 7.8 ul DEPC water per tube. The kinds of DNA and primers will decide the amount of how many tubes we need to run the machine. After deploying the solution, set the machine and run it about 3 hours then will show out the result.</p>

			<h2>introduction</h2>
			<p> We used gold and graphene as the material of the electrode, and fabricated the entire chip by means of a lithography process, and finally used cyclic voltammetry to test the results.</p>
			<h2>experiment</h2>
			<h3>Planar Electrode</h3>
			<p> First, the glass substrate with ITO was immersed in acetone at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove the organic particles or dust, then it was immersed in methanol at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove acetone, then finally it was immersed in diH2O at ultrasonic for 5 min, which the glass was dried by nitrogen gun after completing the above clean process. Testing which side is coating ITO with electric meter after taking the glass and bake it for 15 min at 120°C to prevent the residual -OH from reacting with the PR. The side of ITO was applied HMDS to enhance PR adhesion before applied PR, which used spin coater in 3000 rpm 10 s at 1 step to attach the drug and 5000 rpm 20 s at 2 step to control the thickness of the drug. Note that the two drugs cannot produce any bubbles during the process of dropping the glass substrate. Sending PR-coated ITO to do soft baking for 2 min at 90°C to let PR dry a little and enhance the adhesion. After the glass was soft baking, exposing the pattern of the mask irradiating at a 365 nm ultraviolet light with a mercury lamp for 2.5 s. The way to use that is positive PR, in other words, the part is not covered by the mask and directly contacts the UV light will be eroded. Send the glass to do bake after exposure for 1 min at 90°C to prevent erosion ripples around the chip before developing. Then, the chip was soaked in the developer AZ300MIF and oscillated to remove the etched photoresist, and the PR was observed by a light aligner, a microscope, and a projection comparator, and then sent to do hard baking at 120°C for 15 min to fix the light, which prevents erosion during the moment. Soak the developed ITO in the etchant for approximately 10 min. The formula of etchant is hydrochloric acid 36%, nitric acid 70% and diH2O and the ratio is 50:3:50. The glass immersed in acetone and shook it to get rid of PR and the pattern of ITO electrode would be developed clearly. Finally, the glass substrate printed with the first electrode was placed in a 100% acetone shake to remove the photoresist, and the first electrode on the chip was completed.</p>
			<p> After confirming the state of the first electrode, the process of the second electrode will be performed on the same chip. The chip was immersed in acetone at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove the organic particles or dust, then it was immersed in methanol at the ultrasonic for 5 min to remove acetone, then finally it was immersed in diH2O at ultrasonic for 5 min, which the chip was dried by nitrogen gun after completing the above clean process. Bake it for 15 min at 120°C to prevent the residual -OH from reacting with the PR. The side of electrode was applied HMDS to enhance PR adhesion before applied PR, which used spin coater in 3000 rpm 10 s at 1 step to attach the drug and 5000 rpm 20 s at 2 step to control the thickness of the drug. Note that the two drugs cannot produce any bubbles during the process of dropping the glass substrate. Sending PR-coated chip to do soft baking for 2 min at 90°C to let PR dry a little and enhance the adhesion. After the chip was soft baking, exposing the second mask, which have to align the cross pattern of the first pattern and irradiating at a 365 nm ultraviolet light with a mercury lamp for 2.5 s. The part is not covered by the mask and directly contacts the UV light will be eroded. Send the chip to do bake after exposure for 1 min at 90°C to prevent erosion ripples around the chip before developing. Then, the chip was soaked in the developer AZ300MIF and oscillated to remove the etched PR, and the PR was observed by a light aligner, a microscope, and a projection comparator to observe the erosion PR. A layer of approximately 1500 – 1600 Å of gold is then plated with a thermal evaporator. Before the gold plating, the machine must be vacuumed, and the surface of the chip electrode is plated with titanium under vacuum to strengthen the adhesion of gold. Then the solid gold is placed on the tungsten sheet in the evaporation machine, and the time of process is about 9-10 minutes. The gaseous gold will be solidification on the surface of the chip, and after the chip is taken out of the thermal evaporator, the acetone is removed to the PR, and the chip is completed.</p>
			<h3>Platform Electrode</h3>
			<p> First, titanium is plated on the silicon substrate by a thermal resistance vapor deposition machine to increase the affinity between Au and silicon substrate. Then evaporate a layer of gold from approximately 1500 – 1600 Å. The graphene growing on the PMMA membrane was then tiled on the gold, and the test chip was completed.</p>
			<h3>Cyclic Voltammetry</h3>
			<p> Before performing the individual connection test between the electrode material and the DNA, the chip must be cleaned with acetone and methanol separately. After the chip is packaged, the initial CV pattern of the chip can be obtained for the first measurement, and then dropped into the environment at 25 ° C. The ssDNA of 10 mM/1 mM/0.1 mM was rested for 16 hr for DNA ligation, and then the DNA was ligated to the chip to obtain a CV chart.</p>
			<p> The surface of the gold electrode needs to be modified to join the DNA. After the chip package is completed, it must first be cleaned by cyclic voltammetry.The first wash was carried out at 1 M NaOH at a speed of 0.3 V / s in the range -0.2 to + 0.8 V, followed by a second wash in 0.5 M H2SO4 at a speed of 0.3 V / s and a range of -0.25 to + 1.75 V.Next, SH modification of the surface of the gold electrode was carried out by placing 1,4-benzenedithiol 10 mM, 10 mL/each for 24 hours.</p>
